<h2>Stock Market Functions Add-In Overview</h2>

The Stock Market Functions (SMF) add-in is a collection of user-defined functions (UDF) that can allow you to retrieve data from web pages and web queries via EXCEL formulas.  To use an add-in, you need to download it to your computer and install it (a simple process).  For general information on add-ins, refer to:<br>

<br><br><br><u><b>How do I install the add-in?</b></u><br><br>

<table>

<tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>First step would be to create this directory on your computer:
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C:\Program Files\SMF Add-In
<br>
<br>Next, you'd download the current ZIP archive of the add-in from this group's files area into that directory and extract all of the files from the ZIP archive there. Then, you'd need to tell EXCEL to use it. In EXCEL 2002, that process is:
<ol>
<li>Open a new workbook</li>
<li>Use menu option > Tools > Add-Ins > Browse</li>
<li>Browse to the XLA file that was extracted from the ZIP archive and double-click on it</li>
</ol>
That should be all you need to do.
<br><br>Note -- the reason a non-standard add-in path was used above is to ease sharing of workbooks that use the add-in.  Because of how EXCEL saves UDF (User Defined Function) formula usage, sharing works best if the add-in is located in the same location on both the computer that created the workbook and the computer that is opening the workbook.  If you don't use the recommended directory above, the add-in will still work, but you will have to manually update workbook links when you open any workbook created by someone who had their version of the add-in located elsewhere.  Also, older versions of EXCEL treat add-in locations differently, so they may require you to manually locate the add-in when opening up a workbook created on another machine.  In many cases, saving the workbook on your machine first may ease the resolution of this location problem.

<br><br><u><b>What does the add-in do?</b></u>

<table><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td><br>There are five primary user-defined functions that the SMF add-in provides:

<ul>
<li>=RCHGetElementNumber() is a UDF that returns a specific data element from a specified data source (i.e. web page).  For example, this formula would return the Market Capitalization amount from Yahoo's <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ks?s=IBM">Key Statistics</a> page for ticker "IBM":

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=RCHGetElementNumber("IBM", 941)

<br><br>More detailed documentation on the RCHGetElementNumber() function can be found here:
<a href="http://finance.groups.yahoo.com/group/smf_addin/files/Documentation/2.0 - RCHGetElementNumber.html">2.0 - RCHGetElementNumber.html</a>

<br><br><li>=RCHGetTableCell() is a UDF that extracts a specific data element from a specified web page. Most RCHGetElementNumber() functions are actually just an RCHGetTableCell() function with the parameters saved and assigned to an element number. For example, this formula would return the Market Capitalization amount from Yahoo's <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ks?s=IBM">Key Statistics</a> page for ticker "IBM":

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=RCHGetTableCell("http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ks?s=IBM",1,">Market Cap")

<br><br>More detailed documentation on the RCHGetTableCell() function can be found here:
<a href="http://finance.groups.yahoo.com/group/smf_addin/files/Documentation/5.1 - RCHGetTableCell.html">5.1 - RCHGetTableCell.html</a>

<br><br><li>=RCHGetYahooQuotes() is a UDF that returns delayed stock quotes and other data from the Yahoo quotes interface.  For example, this formula would return a range of data showing the last trading price, the price/sales ratio, and the price/book ratio for "IBM" and "MMM":

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=RCHGetYahooQuotes("IBM,MMM", "l1p5p6")

<br><br>More detailed documentation on the RCHGetYahooQuotes() function can be found here:
<a href="http://finance.groups.yahoo.com/group/smf_addin/files/Documentation/3.0 - RCHGetYahooQuotes.html">3.0 - RCHGetYahooQuotes.html</a>

<br><br><li>=RCHGetYahooHistory() is a UDF that returns historical stock quotes from the Yahoo historical quotes interface.  For example, this formula would return a range of data containing historical quotes data from 6/1/2006 thru 6/16/2006 for "IBM":

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=RCHGetYahooHistory("IBM", 2006, 6, 1, 2006, 6, 16)

<br><br>More detailed documentation on the RCHGetYahooHistory() function can be found here:
<a href="http://finance.groups.yahoo.com/group/smf_addin/files/Documentation/4.0 - RCHGetYahooHistory.html">4.0 - RCHGetYahooHistory.html</a>

<br><br><li>=RCHGetHTMLTable() is a UDF that is used to extract an HTML table from a web page.  For example, this formula would return a range of data containing a table from Yahoo's Key Statistics page:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=RCHGetHTMLTable("http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ks?s=MMM","Market Cap (intraday)",-1,"",1) 

<br><br>More detailed documentation on the RCHGetHTMLTable() function can be found here:
