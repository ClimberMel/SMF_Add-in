<h2>Documentation for Force Recalculation macro</h2>

<br><br>There was no documentation found for the Force Recalculation macro so I have added this.

<br><br>I have always had the Force Recalculation macro in my own personal macros and then have a shortcut on my menu bar to access both it 
        and the smfFixLinks macro.  This allows me to run them quickly and also resolves when on occasion the add-in 
        doesn't appear when first opening a new workbook.

        Here is the macro if you want to copy it to your own personal macros:<br><br>

<p style="margin-left:40px">
    Public Sub smfForceRecalculation()<br>
&nbsp&nbsp    sAdvFNPrefix = ""<br>
&nbsp&nbsp    sAdvFNPrefix = ""<br>
&nbsp&nbsp    iCookieInit = 0<br>
&nbsp&nbsp    Erase aData, aGuruFocusItems<br>
&nbsp&nbsp    If Val(Application.Version) < 10 Then<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp    Application.CalculateFull<br>
&nbsp&nbsp    Else<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp    Application.CalculateFull<br>
&nbsp&nbsp    End If<br>
    End Sub<br>
    <br>
</p>
