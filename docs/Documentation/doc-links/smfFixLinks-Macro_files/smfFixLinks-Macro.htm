<h2>Preliminary Documentation for smfFixLinks-Macro</h2>

<br><br>There was no documentation found for the SMFFixLinks Macro so I will add this to the TO-DO list.

<br><br>I have always had the smfFixLinks-Macro in my own personal macros and then have a shortcut on my menu bar to access both it 
        and the Force Recalculation macro.  This allows me to run them quickly and also resolves when on occasion the add-in 
        doesn't appear when first opening a new workbook.

        Here is the macro if you want to copy it to your own personal macros:<br><br>

<p style="margin-left:40px">
    Public Sub smfFixLinks()<br>
&nbsp&nbsp    Dim Sht As Worksheet<br>
&nbsp&nbsp    For Each Sht In Worksheets<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp        Sht.Cells.Replace _<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp            What:="'*\RCH_Stock_Market_Functions.xla'!", _<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp            Replacement:="", _<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp            LookAt:=xlPart, _<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp            SearchOrder:=xlByRows, _<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp            MatchCase:=False, _<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp            SearchFormat:=False, _<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp            ReplaceFormat:=False<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp        Next Sht<br>
&nbsp&nbsp    End Sub<br>
    <br>
</p>    
... to be continued.
