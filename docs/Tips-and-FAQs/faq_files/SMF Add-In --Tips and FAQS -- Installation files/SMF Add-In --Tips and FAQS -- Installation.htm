<h1>SMF Add-In --Tips and FAQS -- Installation</h1>

<h3><u>What is the add-in?</u></h3>

<div style="margin-left: 2em;">

    <p>The Stock Market Functions (SMF) add-in is primarily a collection of 
    user-defined functions (UDF) for EXCEL, that can allow data to be 
    extracted and/or retrieved from web pages and files and placed directly 
    into EXCEL cells or ranges.</p>

    <p>The add-in cannot be used with Open Office, and it cannot be used on 
    the Mac without a simulated Windows environment. Coding is in place for 
    using the add-in natively on the Mac, but I've had no response from 
    people that said they'd test it.</p>
</div>

<h3><u>How do I install the add-in?</u></h3>

<div style="margin-left: 2em;">
    <p>There is no automated installer, but it only takes a few steps:</p>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Create this folder on your PC ==&gt; <b>C:\SMF Add-In</b></li>
        <li>Download the ZIP archive that contains the current version of the add-in from the <a href="https://climbermel.github.io/SMF_Add-in/"><b>top page of the SMF web site</b></a> into that directory.</li>
        <li><b>Extract <u>ALL</u></b> files from the ZIP archive into the folder you just created.</li>
        <li>Start EXCEL and open a new workbook</li>
        <li>Go to the add-in manager (keyboard shortcut alt+t+i) and click on the <b><u>Browse...</u></b> button.</li>
        <li>Browse to the folder you just created, and select the XLA file from that folder.</li>
    </ol>

    <p> That's all you need to do. There should now be a line in the add-in 
        manager for "Stock Market Functions add-in", with a checked box in front
        of it. However, an easy way to verify if the add-in is installed is to 
        try this function in your worksheet:</p>

    <b style="margin-left: 1em;">=RCHGetElementNumber("Version")</b>

    <p>If the add-in wasn't installed properly, you will get a #NAME? error 
    with that function. Otherwise, it should tell you which version of the 
    add-in you have installed, as well as echoing back which folder you have
    the add-in installed in. For example:</p>

    <b style="margin-left: 1em;">Stock Market Functions add-in, Version 3.0.2023.06.08 (C:\SMF Add-In; Windows (64-bit) NT 6.02; 14.0; ; ; 1)</b>

</div>

<h3><u>How do I uninstall the add-in?</u></h3><div style="margin-left: 2em;">
    <p>Again, just a few steps:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Start EXCEL and open a new workbook.</li>
        <li>Go to the add-in manager (keyboard shortcut alt+t+i) and uncheck the box in front of the "Stock Market Functions add-in" list item.</li>
        <li>Exit EXCEL. At this point, EXCEL should no longer be aware of the SMF add-in when you open it up.</li>
        <li>Optional: Delete the folder and files that were created when you installed the add-in</li>
    </ol>

    <p></p>

</div>

<h3><u>Special Notes</u></h3><div style="margin-left: 2em;">

<div>
    <ol>
        <li>In July of 2016, Microsoft did a security update that affects the latest several versions of the O/S and EXCEL. 
            This security update inadvertently prevents EXCEL from being able to load add-ins when it starts up. 
            Until they can fix the problem, they have suggested a workaround of unblocking the XLA file.
